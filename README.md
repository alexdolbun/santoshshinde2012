# Hello, That's Me!

#### Full Stack Developer | Node | Typescript | React | Ionic | Vue | Angular | Javascript Enthusiast, Learner 

I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with over 6 Year's Experience and I want to make things that make a simple. 

Iâ€™ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. 

And I am always interested to work on the back end as well as the front end.

I currently work at Neosoft technologies where I develop dynamic applications for the web using Node, Angular, Express, MongoDB, React, Vue Js.
